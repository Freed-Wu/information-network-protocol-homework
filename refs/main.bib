  title={Dyson: An Architecture for Extensible Wireless LANs},
  year={2010},
  publisher={USENIX Association},
  address={USA},
  abstract={Dyson is a new software architecture for building customizable WLANs. While research
              in wireless networks has made great strides, these advancements have not seen the
              light of day in real WLAN deployments. One of the key reasons is that today's WLANs
              are not architected to embrace change. For example, system administrators cannot fine-tune
              the association policy for their particular environment: an administrator may know
              certain nodes in certain locations interfere with each other and cause a severe degradation
              in throughput, and hence, such associations must be avoided in the particular deployment.
              Dyson defines a set of APIs that allow clients and APs to send pertinent information
              such as radio channel conditions to a central controller. The central controller processes
              this information, to form a global view of the network. This global view, combined
              with historical information about spatial and temporal usage patterns, allows the
              central controller enact a rich set of policies to control the network's behavior.
              Dyson provides a Python-based scripting API that allows the central controller's policies
              to be extended for site-specific customizations and new optimizations that leverage
              historical knowledge. We have built a prototype implementation of Dyson, which currently
              runs on a 28-node testbed distributed across one floor of a typical academic building.
              Using this testbed, we examine various aspects of the architecture in detail, and
              demonstrate the ease of implementing a wide range of policies. Using Dyson, we demonstrate
              optimizing associations, handling VoIP clients, reserving airtime for specific users,
              and optimizing handoffs for mobile clients.},

  title={Designing High Performance Enterprise Wi-Fi Networks},
  year={2008},
  isbn={1119995555221},
  publisher={USENIX Association},
  address={USA},
  abstract={Use of mobile computing devices such as laptops, PDAs, and Wi-Fi enabled phones is
              increasing in the workplace. As the usage of corporate 802.11 wireless networks (WLANs)
              grows, network performance is becoming a significant concern. We have built DenseAP,
              a novel system for improving the performance of enterprise WLANs using a dense deployment
              of access points (APs). In sharp contrast with wired networks, one cannot increase
              the capacity of a WLAN by simply deploying more equipment (APs). To increase capacity,
              the APs must be assigned appropriate channels and the clients must make intelligent
              decisions about which AP to associate with. Furthermore, the decisions about channel
              assignment, and associations must be based on a global view of the entire WLAN, rather
              than the local viewpoint of an individual client or AP. Given the diversity of Wi-Fi
              devices in use today, another constraint on the design of DenseAP is that it must
              not require any modification to Wi-Fi clients. In this paper, we show how the DenseAP
              system addresses these challenges, and provides significant improvements in performance
              over existing WLANs.},
